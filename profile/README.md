**Reactive Network** serves as a fully EVM-compatible interoperable execution layer, enabling developers to craft
the next wave of dApps with the novel concept of Reactive Smart Contracts.

lifecycle. While user input controls the flow of traditional Smart Contracts through transactions posted to a
blockchain network, Reactive Smart Contracts are driven by the data flows within various blockchain ecosystems.
